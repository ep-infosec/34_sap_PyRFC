Installation
============

If `SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK <https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/nwrfcsdk.html>`_ and Python
are already installed on your system, you can pip install the :mod:`pyrfc` wheel from the `latest release <https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases/latest>`_,
or clone this repository and build :mod:`pyrfc` from the source code, following :ref:`build`.

Use the Python 3 and the latest pyrfc and SAP NWRFC SDK release (fully backwards compatible).

.. _install-c-connector:

SAP NWRFC SDK Installation
===========================

If SAP NWRFC SDK is already installed on your system, you may verify the installation by running the ``rfcexec`` utility, without any parameter.

The error message like below indicates that SAP NWRFC SDK installation is technically correct, expecting more input parameters.
Different error message may be caused by missing Windows C++ binary for example, or another installation inconsistency:

     .. code-block:: sh

        $ cd /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/bin
        $ ./rfcexec
        Error: Not all mandatory parameters specified
        Please start the program in the following way:
        rfcexec -t -a <program ID> -g <gateway host> -x <gateway service>
                -f <file with list of allowed commands> -s <allowed Sys ID>
        The options "-t" (trace), "-f" and "-s" are optional.


Information on where to download the SAP NWRFC SDK you may find `here <https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/nwrfcsdk.html>`_ .

The PyRFC connector relies on *SAP NWRFC SDK* and must be able to find the library
files at runtime. Therefore, you might either install the *SAP NWRFC SDK*
in the standard library paths of your system or install it in any location and tell the
Python connector where to look.

Here are configuration examples for Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems.

Windows
-------

1. Create the SAP NWRFC SDK home directory, e.g. ``c:\nwrfcsdk``
2. Set the SAPNWRFC_HOME env variable: ``SAPNWRFC_HOME=c:\nwrfcsdk``
3. Unpack the SAP NWRFC SDK archive to it, e.g. ``c:\nwrfcsdk\lib`` shall exist.
4. Include the ``lib`` directory to the library search path on Windows, i.e.
   :ref:`extend<install-problems-envvar-win>` the ``PATH`` environment variable.

Add ``c:\nwrfcsdk\lib`` to PATH.

Linux
-----

1. Create the SAP NWRFC SDK home directory, e.g. ``/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk``
2. Set the SAPNWRFC_HOME env variable: ``SAPNWRFC_HOME=/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk``
3. Unpack the SAP NWRFC SDK archive to it, e.g. ``/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib`` shall exist.
4. Include the ``lib`` directory in the library search path:

   * As ``root``, create a file ``/etc/ld.so.conf.d/nwrfcsdk.conf`` and
     enter the following values:

     .. code-block:: sh

        # include nwrfcsdk
        /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib

   * As ``root``, run the command ``ldconfig``. To check if libraries are installed:

     .. code-block:: sh

        $ ldconfig -p | grep sap # should show something like:
          libsapucum.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib/libsapucum.so
          libsapnwrfc.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib/libsapnwrfc.so
          libicuuc.so.50 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib/libicuuc.so.50
          libicui18n.so.50 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib/libicui18n.so.50
          libicudecnumber.so (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib/libicudecnumber.so
          libicudata.so.50 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib/libicudata.so.50
          libgssapi_krb5.so.2 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgssapi_krb5.so.2
          libgssapi.so.3 (libc6,x86-64) => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgssapi.so.3
        $

macOS
-----

The macOS firewall stealth mode is by default active, blocking the ICMP protocol based network access to Macbook. Applications like
Ping do not work by default (`Can't ping a machine - why? <https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2554739>`_) and the stealth mode
must be disabled:

.. code-block:: sh

    sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode off

1. Create the SAP NWRFC SDK root directory ``/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk`` (this location is fixed, more info below)
2. Set SAPNWRFC_HOME environment variable to that location: ``SAPNWRFC_HOME=/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk``
3. Unpack the SAP NWRFC SDK archive to it, e.g. ``/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib`` shall exist.
4. Set the remote paths in SAP NWRFC SDK by running `paths_fix.sh <https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/blob/master/ci/utils/paths_fix.sh>`_ script.
5. Unzip the `uchar.zip` file attached to `SAP OSS Note 2573953 <https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2573953>`_
   and copy the `uchar.h` file to SAP NWRFC SDK include directory

This location is fixed to the default ``/usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib`` rpath, embedded into node-rfc package published on npm.

After moving SAP NWRFC SDK to another location on your system, the rpaths must be adjusted in SAP NWRFC SDK and in pyrfc.so libraries.

For SAP NWRFC SDK, set the SAPNWRFC_HOME env variable to new SAP NWRFC SDK root directory and re-run the above script.

For pyrfc:

     .. code-block:: sh

        $ unzip unzip pyrfc-2.0.1-cp38-cp38-macosx_10_15_x86_64.whl
        $ cd pyrfc
        $ install_name_tool -rpath /usr/local/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib <new path> _pyrfc.cpython-38-darwin.so


.. _install-python-connector:

Python Connector Installation
=============================

Download the wheel from your platform, from the `latest release <https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases/latest>`_ and pip install.

Using virtual environments you can isolate Python/PyRFC projects, working without administrator privileges.

Windows
-------

.. _`install-python-win`:

* If not already installed, install the Python first: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

  Add Python and Scripts directories to ``PATH`` environment variable, e.g.

  .. code-block:: none

     set PATH=c:\Python37;c:\Python37\Scripts;%PATH%

* Install ``pip`` if not already included: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

* Install the Python connector from the `latest release <https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases/latest>`_

  .. code-block:: sh

     wget https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases/download/2.0.0/pyrfc-2.0.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

     pip install pyrfc-1.9.97-cp37-cp37m-macosx_10_14_x86_64.whl

  Please look up the correct wheel name, depending on your platform and Python version.

* Run ``python`` and type ``from pyrfc import *``. If this finishes silently, without oputput, the installation was successful.

Linux
-----

.. _`install-python-linux`:

* Install Python 3

* Install ``pip`` if not already included: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

* Install the Python connector from the `latest release <https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases/latest>`_

  .. code-block:: sh

     wget https://github.com/SAP/PyRFC/releases/download/2.0.0/pyrfc-2.0.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl

     pip install pyrfc-1.9.94-cp37-cp37m-linux_x86_64.whl

  Please look up the correct wheel name, depending on your platform and Python version.

* Run ``python`` and type ``from pyrfc import *``. If this finishes silently, without oputput, the installation was successful.

macOS
-----

.. _`install-python-macOS`:

The macOS system version of Python is usually the older one and using wirtual environments,
like `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_ for example, is recommended:

.. code-block:: sh

   pyenv install 3.8.0
   pyenv virtualenv 3.8.0 py380

Install the Python connector the same way like for Linux.

.. _install-problems:

Problems
========

Behind a Proxy
--------------

If you are within an internal network that accesses the internet through
an HTTP(S) proxy, some of the shell commands will fail with urlopen errors, etc.

Assuming that your HTTP(S) proxy could be accessed via ``http://proxy:8080``, on Windows
you can communicate this proxy to your shell via::

    SET HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:8080
    SET HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy:8080

or permanently set environment variables.


SAP NW RFC Library Installation
-------------------------------

1.  ``ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.``

    (Windows)
    This error indicates that the Python connector was not able to find the
    C connector on your system. Please check, if the ``lib`` directory of the
    C connector is in your ``PATH`` environment variable.

2. ``ImportError: DLL load failed: %1 is not a valid Win32 application.``

   (Windows)
   This error occurs when SAP NW RFC Library 64bit version is installed on a system with 32bit version Python.

Environment variables
---------------------

.. _install-problems-envvar-win:

Windows
'''''''
The environment variable may be set within a command prompt via the ``set``
command, e.g.

* ``set PATH=%PATH%;C:\nwrfcsdk\lib`` (extend PATH with the C connector lib)
* ``set HTTPS_PROXY=proxy:8080`` (setting an proxy for HTTPS communication)

When the command prompt is closed, the environment variable is reset. To achieve
a persistent change of the environment variable, do the following (Windows 7):

1. Open the Start Menu and type ``environment`` into the search box.
2. A window opens in which the user variables are displayed in the upper part
   and the system variables in the lower part. You may select and edit
   the desired variable.
3. The modified variables are used when a *new* command prompt is opened.
